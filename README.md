# Anki analysis

I use spaced repetition to study. Here are some notebooks where I unpack the SQLite database of each card review.

A big thanks to the team at [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) for their great product and [documentation](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/wiki/Database-Structure).

Other tools used:

- SQLite
- Python: time, pandas, matplotlib
